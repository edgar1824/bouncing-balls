## How to Use

1. Compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript. If you don't have TypeScript installed you can do it using:

   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

   To compile the TypeScript code, navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   tsc
   ```

   This will generate the necessary JavaScript files.
